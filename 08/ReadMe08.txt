Pleasee, use 'Python3 vmtranslator.py <file_path>' when you test the code.
If there is only one vm file in the target folder, specify the file name (to '.vm')
Else, only specify to the folder name. '.asm' file will generate in the anticipated folder
with the folder name

Bug Report: I am having troubles with bootstraping and implementing multiple file translation.
The NestedCall test script could generate the right output except RAM[0] and RAM[6]
I will try to solve this in following submissions, trying my best to be on time.
Please, do allow me to submit it maybe after next week's office hour.


UPDATE: I have corrected the problem with RAM[6] but still stuck at RAM[0] in NestedCall.
I will look for further help with this one.
Please, do allow me to submit it maybe after next week's office hour.

UPDATE2: Now solved ALMOST all problems, leaving only StaticsTest not passing. Will look into it.

UPDATE3: Now everything should work.
